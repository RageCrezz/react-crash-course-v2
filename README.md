# My personal Sandbox

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The project serves for personal training about basic JavaScript understanding via ReactJS environment.
Over time the project will grow to cover a lot of aspects about modern day technology in the frontend.

## Runnable Scripts

### `yarn`

Run `yarn` as first script to build the project before running.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
